ABOUT ME
From selling electronics on the buzzing streets of Nigeria to managing mouthwatering empanadas in Panama â€”and now uncovering insights through dataâ€”Iâ€™ve had quite the journey!
Iâ€™m a versatile professional with over 7 years of experience in sales, hands-on leadership in food production and marketing, and an academic background in Biology, Biotechnology (B.Sc.), and Food Safety (M.Sc.). My passion for problem-solving, systems thinking, and business strategy naturally led me to the world of data analytics.
Now, I'm helping businesses make smarter decisions through data. I turn messy datasets into actionable insights, build dashboards that actually tell stories, and use analytics to solve real-world problemsâ€”especially in sales, marketing, and food safety domains.
Tools I work with:
Power BI | Excel | SQL | Python | DAX | Data Storytelling
 What I care about:
â€¢	Helping small businesses grow using data
â€¢	Making food systems safer and smarter
â€¢	Creating visuals that speak louder than slides
â€¢	Continuous learning and community impact
 Currently building projects across sales, food safety, and economic trends in Panama.
Letâ€™s connect if you're into data, food, strategyâ€”or just curious how an empanada guy became a data guy!

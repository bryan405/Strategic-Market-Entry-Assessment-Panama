### [üë§ About Me](#-about-me)
From selling electronics on the buzzing streets of Nigeria to managing mouthwatering empanadas in Panama ‚Äîand now uncovering insights through data‚ÄîI‚Äôve had quite the journey!
I‚Äôm a versatile professional with over 7 years of experience in sales, hands-on leadership in food production and marketing, and an academic background in Biology, Biotechnology (B.Sc.), and Food Safety (M.Sc.). My passion for problem-solving, systems thinking, and business strategy naturally led me to the world of data analytics.
Now, I'm helping businesses make smarter decisions through data. I turn messy datasets into actionable insights, build dashboards that actually tell stories, and use analytics to solve real-world problems‚Äîespecially in sales, marketing, and food safety domains.
Tools I work with:
Power BI | Excel | SQL | Python | DAX | Data Storytelling
 What I care about:
‚Ä¢	Helping small businesses grow using data
‚Ä¢	Making food systems safer and smarter
‚Ä¢	Creating visuals that speak louder than slides
‚Ä¢	Continuous learning and community impact
 Currently building projects across sales, food safety, and economic trends in Panama.
Let‚Äôs connect if you're into data, food, strategy‚Äîor just curious how an empanada guy became a data guy!
### project overview
We are Dajcom Limited, a leading company in the home appliances, food, and beverage industry. As we explore strategic opportunities to expand our operations into Panama, we are seeking your expertise to support us with a market analysis that will guide our investment and entry decisions.
### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a clear and data-informed overview of Panama‚Äôs economic environment, focusing on the following key areas:
1.	Overall Economic Growth
	What we need: Insights into Panama‚Äôs economic performance based on annual and quarterly GDP trends.
	 This will help us understand the stability and future potential of the market, so we can determine the right time and scale for entering Panama.
2.	Sector Performance
o	What we need: Analysis of which industries contribute most to Panama‚Äôs economy, especially those growing steadily. We are particularly interested in sectors related to food, beverages, manufacturing, logistics, and retail.
o	Why it matters: This will help us identify which sectors to focus on or partner with for sourcing, production, or distribution.
3.	Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
o	What we need: An overview of FDI trends by sector, to see where international companies are choosing to invest.
o	Why it matters: Sectors that attract FDI usually have favorable policies, infrastructure, and growth potential. This will give us confidence about where to align our investment strategy.
4.	Key Economic Indicators
o	What we need: A summary of key figures, such as:
ÔÇß	GDP growth (national and provincial)
ÔÇß	Sectoral contribution to GDP
ÔÇß	Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
ÔÇß	FDI growth by sector
o	Why it matters: These figures will help us compare opportunities and select the best sectors and regions for investment.
5.	Regional and Provincial Insights
o	What we need: Analysis of economic GDP activity at the provincial level, highlighting infrastructure, market access, labor availability, and urbanization.
o	Why it matters: This will help us choose the right locations for operations such as manufacturing, warehousing, or distribution.
6.	Strategic Recommendations
o	What we need: A clear summary of opportunities and risks, along with suggested sectors and regions to prioritize.
o	Why it matters: Your guidance will help ensure our market entry strategy is focused, data-backed, and aligned with Panama‚Äôs economic landscape.
Expected Deliverable
We are looking for a well-structured report that includes data visualizations (such as charts or dashboards) to clearly present insights. The report should include practical takeaways we can use to inform leadership decisions.

üîç Raw Data Overview
The dataset includes FDI values by economic sector along with sector participation and year-over-year variation for 2023.

Data Cleaning Summary ‚Äì FDI by Economic Activity (Panama)
To prepare the dataset for analysis, I first removed irrelevant rows (1‚Äì9, 11, 30‚Äì34) that contained notes or were entirely empty. I promoted the correct header row, which included the years 2017‚Äì2023, to use as column names.
I renamed the first column to "Economic Sector" for clarity, then filtered out rows containing non-data text like explanatory notes and footnotes (e.g., rows 19‚Äì21). I also excluded data from 2020 to 2023 that appeared inconsistent or labeled as provisional.
Next, I removed the last two columns‚Äîparticipation percentage and year-over-year variation‚Äîsince they weren't needed for our core analysis and could be recalculated later if needed.
I checked for and confirmed there were no duplicate rows. Then I used fill down to complete any missing sector names, corrected the data types (ensuring years were numeric and FDI values were in number format), and unpivoted the dataset from wide to long format for easier analysis.
Finally, I renamed the columns to:
‚Ä¢	Economic Sector
‚Ä¢	Year
‚Ä¢	FDI Economic value
The cleaned dataset now has 119 rows and 3 columns.
Cleaned file name: FDI by Economic Activity (Panama, 2017‚Äì2023)

File Format: CSV
________________________________________
‚úÖ Cleaning Steps:
‚Ä¢	Removed Metadata & Non-Tabular Content:
All introductory rows, footnotes, and subtotals in column 1 were excluded to isolate the actual dataset.
‚Ä¢	Filtered Sector Rows:
In column 2, any rows containing national sectors or categories not related to specific provinces were removed ‚Äî to focus only on GDP by province.
‚Ä¢	Promoted & Renamed Headers:
The row with actual column names was promoted. The column "Descripci√≥n" was renamed to province for clarity.
‚Ä¢	Dropped Irrelevant Columns:
Retained only columns with year-based GDP values and the province name; any non-essential columns were excluded.
‚Ä¢	Reshaped the Data (Unpivoted):

Topic: Quarterly GDP by Economic Activity
Unit: Millions of Balboas (B/.)
Period Covered: 2018‚Äì2023
File Format: CSV
________________________________________
‚úÖ Cleaning Steps:
‚Ä¢	Removed Metadata and Footnotes:
The first few rows (columns 1 and 2) contained metadata like titles, descriptions, and footnotes that were not part of the tabular data. These rows were removed to ensure the dataset begins with clean, structured values suitable for analysis.
‚Ä¢	Promoted Headers & Renamed Columns:
Promoted the row with the actual Year-Quarter values as headers. Renamed "Descripci√≥n" to sector to make the column name more intuitive and analysis-friendly.
‚Ä¢	Excluded Non-Granular Totals and Aggregates:
Rows like "Valor Agregado Bruto", "Impuestos sobre la producci√≥n netos" and "Producto Interno Bruto a precios de comprador" (rows 19, 20, 21) were removed. These rows are national-level totals and not individual sector activities. Including them would have caused duplication or skewed sector-level analysis.
‚Ä¢	Filtered Only Sector-Level Records:
Removed totals, summaries, or duplicate groupings to ensure the dataset focused solely on specific economic activity categories. This makes time-series and comparative sector analysis more precise.
‚Ä¢	Unpivoted Wide Data to Tidy Format:
Converted quarter-based columns into rows (long format), resulting in three columns: sector, Quarter, and Q_GDP_Value. This structure supports easier filtering, visualization, and aggregation.
‚Ä¢	Standardized Sector Names:
Cleaned up inconsistent spelling, extra spaces, and symbols ‚Äî for example, "Otra producci√≥n no de mercado (1)" in column row 18‚Äî to improve consistency, avoid duplicate groupings, and simplify data filtering.
‚Ä¢	Validated Data Types:
Ensured that the Quarter field is in text format (e.g., 2018Q1) for consistency and Confirmed that Q_GDP_Value is numeric (float), removing thousands of separators and handling currency symbols to ensure smooth calculation and aggregation.
‚Ä¢	Removed Duplicates and Total Rows:
Checked for duplicate records (e.g., repeated sectors for the same quarter) and removed subtotal or total rows to maintain one clean, unique entry per sector per quarter.

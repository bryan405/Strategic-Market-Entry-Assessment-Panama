[👤 About Me](#-ABOUT ME
From selling electronics on the buzzing streets of Nigeria to managing mouthwatering empanadas in Panama —and now uncovering insights through data—I’ve had quite the journey!
I’m a versatile professional with over 7 years of experience in sales, hands-on leadership in food production and marketing, and an academic background in Biology, Biotechnology (B.Sc.), and Food Safety (M.Sc.). My passion for problem-solving, systems thinking, and business strategy naturally led me to the world of data analytics.
Now, I'm helping businesses make smarter decisions through data. I turn messy datasets into actionable insights, build dashboards that actually tell stories, and use analytics to solve real-world problems—especially in sales, marketing, and food safety domains.
Tools I work with:
Power BI | Excel | SQL | Python | DAX | Data Storytelling
 What I care about:
•	Helping small businesses grow using data
•	Making food systems safer and smarter
•	Creating visuals that speak louder than slides
•	Continuous learning and community impact
 Currently building projects across sales, food safety, and economic trends in Panama.
Let’s connect if you're into data, food, strategy—or just curious how an empanada guy became a data guy!
